# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	* An organized way to keep track of changes that have been made to code over time, by one or more people. It allows everyone involved to see who made what changes, when, and protects the original base/master code in its original form. Also, multiple people can work on code, making changes and improvements and collaborate those changes back together. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	*A track that will allow you to work on a file of code that will be separate from the master version. You will be able to refer back to the changes you made, making it easier to find bugs and distinguish who did what feature adds. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	* Confirms and records the changes made to code, submitting to the repository. A good comomit message describes in details what changes were made to the code since the last commit. 
* What is a merge conflict?
	* When two separate modifications have been made on the same file and to the same piece of code. The system will not be able to merge those commits.
